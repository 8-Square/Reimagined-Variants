## Reimagined Variants 
Reimagined Variants is a mod that adds Variants to wooden tools into minecraft

This mod adds variants to wooden tools (e.g. Cherry Pickaxe, Warped Shovel), along with advancements, buffs, recipes and custom stats. 

**Currently the mod includes:**
- 10 Wooden Variant Toolsets (5 tools in each)
- Advancements for each toolset
- Recipes
- Custom anvil repair materials for all toolset items
- Buffs when in the tool's corresponding biome 

### Crafting Recipes
All Crafting Recipes are exactly like their vanilla wooden counterparts, simply add the specific wood type to the crafting table and craft how you regularly would with wooden tools 




More Features and Variants are planned in the future...
